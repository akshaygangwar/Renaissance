Readme for Renaissance

### What is Renaissance ###
Renaissance is the name of the student society at GEC, New Delhi. This readme corresponds to the app created for Renaissance.  

### Why is it here ###
The sole purpose for putting this up was because I had to keep the source code in a repo, plus it has chunks of code that might help you in developing parts of an android app that you might be developing. 

### Code and General Feedback can be sent to [Akshay Gangwar](http://www.akshaygangwar.in/contactme.html)
